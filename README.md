## I. Motivation
Just wanted to get more familiar with writing go code and since I had some prior
experience with Supreme's backend I could focus mainly on writing go.

## II. Usage
This project is currently not ready for release but if you'd like to mess around
with it here's how...


**Create a new instance and fetch the latest stock from supreme.**
```go
s := CreateNewInstance()
s.FetchStock()
```
