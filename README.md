## I. Motivation
Just wanted to get more familiar with writing go code and since I had some prior
experience with Supreme's backend I could focus mainly on writing go.

## II. Usage
This project is currently not ready for release but if you'd like to mess around
with it here's how...


**Example usage:**
```go
// Create a new instance and initialize it.
s := gosupreme.New()
s.Init()

// Get all products that have the keyword "6-panel" in their name
p, err := s.GetProductsByKeyword("6-panel")
if err != nil {
  log.Fatal(err)
  return
}

// Loop through all of those products and fetch their product data (styles, sizes, etc...) and print it to console.
for _, product := range *p {
  fmt.Print(product)
  d, err := s.FetchProductData(product)
  if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
    return
  }
  fmt.Println(d)
}
```

**Output of the code above:**
```shell
